# Personal Website
Repo for my personal website, created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

My goal is to make a sort of resume website that lists all my skills and coding accomplishments. This project has allowed me to learn some basic web dev skills and how to put together a website.

This project is currently: INACTIVE
