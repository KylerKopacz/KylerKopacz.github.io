        <p> I am a sophomore Computer Science Major at Amherst College. I'm glad that you visited my website.
          Below is some more information about me that you might not get just by looking at a resume or job
          application. I hope you enjoy your stay! </p>

        <h1>Career Goals</h1>
        <p>Right now, I feel like there are three paths that I could take in the computer
          science world:

        <h3>Systems/Low-Level</h3>
        <p>One thing that I have really come to appreciate is low-level systems programming.
          After taking a systems course at Amherst College, I have seen low-level programming as
          a very precise and efficient way of programming that takes requires a great attention to detail.
          Something about being asked to writeefficient code that runs under a layer 
          of abstraction that most consumers won't see calls to me.
          I think it would be incredbile to write the fast and error-free code that powers autonomous vehicles, 
          self-landing rockets, the latest smartphones, or a new  and powerful computer architecture. To prepare
          myself for this potential career, I have worked with C/C++ to write emulators and other projects, but
          there is still a long way to go.
        </p>

      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>Web Development is everywhere in today's world. Every company has a presence online,
        and for a company to really stand out from the competition, it needs a slick, fast, and
        clean website. There are so many different purposes for websites as well. There are websites for
        commerce, portfolios, marketing, crowd-funding, social media, and many more. I think that it would
        be very cool to learn all there is to know about web design and work to build sleek and powerful
        web applications that allow companies to get ahead. Web Dev also allows my work to be showcased to the world.
        It would be amazing to impact people around the world with software that I wrote and put on the web.

        <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>AI is booming. Everywhere you look, you have companies pouring billions of dollars into AI
          research and applications. Over the past few years we have seen AI do things that were impossible
          only 10 years ago, and the field is only getting started. I have seen what AI can do and how
          it can make a huge impact on people's lives, and I think it would be amazing to be a trailblazer
          in the field of AI. Being able to solve complex problems with AI will push our civilization
          to a new level. AI can help us analyze and solve problems that humans alone could not. The 
          autonomous world would allow humans to focus on other things and allow even more growth for
          society. My hope is to one day work with AI and implement intelligent systems that can
          learn to solve problems. To get there, I will be double majoring in Math at Amherst College
          to build the mathematical foundations necessary to succeed in the AI world.

        <h3>Java</h3>
        <p>Java is my first programming language, and the one I am most proficient in.
          Whenever I need to show my profiency in coding, Java is my go-to language.
          I build apon my Java knowledge every semester at Amherst College, because
          all of our class assignments and labs are written in Java. 
          Check out my GitHub for examples!

        <h3>C/C++</h3>
        <p>I've always had an interest about what goes on under the hood of computers. 
          Learning C/C++ has allowed me to explore low level programming to gain a better
          understanding about how computers work, and I've been able to peel away the abstractions
          of operating systems to see what the kernel and hardware do at the low level. To expand my
          knowledge, I have started to write emulators of old gaming consoles and computer systems.
          My hope is to one day make a working NES emulator that I could load onto my phone and play
          old games wherever I am.

        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and bootstrap to create this responsive website. 
          The more that I have worked with web dev, the more I have come to enjoy the creative
          process. The ability to showcase my work on the web is also exciting for me. I am expanding my
          knowledge of web dev by reading books on JavaScript, and fiddling with things on my website.
          I am also in the process of learning backend programming in Django!

        <h3>Building Computers</h3>
        <p>I've been interested in computers longer than I have been coding.
          When I was 15, I made my first computer. Since then, I have made the workstations
          for my mom's business, and have been keeping up with the release of the 
          latest and fastest computer components. I hope to make another workstation for 
          myself soon!

        <h3>Baseball</h3>
        <p>Baseball has been a passion of mine since I was a kid. My dad played
          professionally when I was a child and some of my earliest memories was
          at the ballparks he would play at. I have played all my life and continue
          to play at Amherst College.

        <h3>Reading</h3>
        <p>More recently, I have gotten into reading. I used to read all the time
          when I was a kid, but unfortunately got away from it when social media
          took over my free time. As of late, I have made a conscious effort to 
          get back into reading, and I am enjoying every second of it. At the moment
          I enjoy non-fiction books about space and physics, and biographies about
          interesting people.
